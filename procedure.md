⭐ When you enter the simulation section, a guided tour will appear. It is strongly recommended that you take the tour for the first time, as it provides step-by-step instructions to help you understand the experiment thoroughly. The tour also introduces you to the various controls, features, and interface elements, making it easier for you to navigate and explore the experiment effectively.

### Task-1: Quantum Tunneling Barrier Analysis and Energy Band Identification

In the first task, the user is presented with quantum tunneling visualizations showing energy band diagrams under different bias conditions. The simulation displays:
- Two energy barrier configurations labeled "thin barrier" and "thick barrier"
- Quantum wave functions showing tunneling probability through each barrier
- Transmission coefficient plots for different barrier widths and heights
- Energy level diagrams with Fermi levels and conduction/valence bands

The user must identify and label each visualization with their respective barrier characteristics and explain how barrier thickness affects tunneling probability and current flow.

### Task-2: Interactive Transport Mechanism Comparison

In the second task, there are interactive plots showing different carrier transport mechanisms where users can observe how various parameters affect transport behavior:
- **Drift Transport**: Adjust electric field strength from 1-100 kV/cm to see velocity saturation effects
- **Diffusion Transport**: Vary carrier concentration gradients to study diffusion currents
- **Ballistic Transport**: Modify device dimensions to observe mean free path effects
- **Tunneling Transport**: Change barrier parameters to see quantum tunneling contributions

Real-time visualization allows users to compare transport velocities, current densities, and response times for each mechanism under identical conditions.

### Task-3: Quantum Tunneling Parameter Optimization

In the third task, users explore quantum tunneling through interactive parameter control:
- **Barrier Width Control**: Adjust tunneling barrier width from 1-5 nm to study exponential transmission dependence
- **Barrier Height Variation**: Modify potential barrier height from 0.2-1.5 eV to observe energy filtering effects
- **Applied Voltage**: Vary bias voltage from 0-1V to see field-assisted tunneling enhancement
- **Temperature Effects**: Change temperature from 77K to 400K to study thermal broadening

Interactive wave function visualization shows probability density distributions and transmission coefficients in real-time.

### Task-4: IMPATT Diode Dynamics and Oscillation Analysis

In the fourth task, the simulation demonstrates IMPATT (Impact Ionization Avalanche Transit Time) diode operation with:
- **Avalanche Multiplication**: Visualize impact ionization events and carrier multiplication
- **Transit Time Effects**: Study carrier drift through depletion region and timing relationships
- **Oscillation Dynamics**: Observe microwave frequency generation and power output
- **Bias Optimization**: Adjust reverse bias voltage to achieve optimal oscillation conditions

Users can analyze current-voltage waveforms, frequency spectrum, and power generation efficiency under different operating conditions.
