      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Esaki diodes exploit tunneling, not avalanche multiplication.",

        "c": "Incorrect. Schottky diodes are fast but not avalanche-based oscillators.",

        "d": "τ_tun depends only on recombination lifetime"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Tunneling is much faster, so τ_tun cannot be greater than τ_dd.",
        "b": "Correct. Tunneling bypasses classical scattering, resulting in sub-picosecond transit times, much faster than drift-diffusion.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Drift transport is inherently slower.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Tunneling depends on barrier width and energy, not recombination."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. PVCR is unrelated to avalanche multiplication; that's for IMPATT diodes.",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Shorter transit times mean higher oscillation frequencies.",
        "b": "Correct. f_osc = 1 / τ_transit, so reducing τ_transit increases f_osc.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Frequency cannot remain constant if transit time changes.",

        "b": "Incorrect. It's not a quadratic dependence.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The dependence is exponential, not linear inverse.",
