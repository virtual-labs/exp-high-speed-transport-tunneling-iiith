      "question": "1. If the measured drift transit time τ_dd = 50 ps and the tunneling transit time τ_tun = 0.5 ps, what is the approximate speedup factor of tunneling?",

        "d": "0.01x"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. 50 ps / 0.5 ps = 100x, not 10x.",
        "b": "Incorrect. It's faster than 50x.",
        "c": "Correct. Tunneling is about 100 times faster than drift transport here.",

      "question": "2. In the Esaki diode I–V curve, the valley voltage V_V was measured at 0.35 V and the peak voltage V_P at 0.15 V. What does this indicate?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "A large negative-resistance region exists between V_P and V_V",
        "b": "Avalanche breakdown dominates at V_V",
        "c": "The diode acts purely as a resistor",
        "d": "The diode cannot operate in high-speed regions"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. A V_P lower than V_V indicates a clear negative-resistance region, enabling high-speed switching.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Avalanche breakdown doesn't occur in Esaki diodes.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The nonlinear I-V characteristic shows it's not just a resistor.",

        "d": "Doping ratio in the Esaki diode"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Recombination is too slow to set GHz frequencies.",
        "b": "Correct. For IMPATT diodes, f_osc ≈ 1 / τ_transit, determined by drift region length and carrier speed.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Barrier thickness affects tunnel diodes, not IMPATT oscillations.",

        "c": "Remain unchanged",
        "d": "Oscillate periodically"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Thinner barriers allow higher tunneling probabilities.",
        "b": "Correct. Transmission probability T ≈ exp(-2κW), so reducing W greatly boosts current.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Barrier width has a significant effect.",
        "d": "Incorrect. There is no periodic oscillation dependence."

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. IMPATT power is mainly set by the avalanche process and applied bias voltage.",
        "b": "Incorrect. PVCR relates to tunnel diodes, not IMPATT output power.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Tunneling doesn't dominate IMPATT diode physics.",

        "a": "Correct. Drift velocity v = μE, and transit time τ_dd = L / v = L / (μE).",
        "b": "Incorrect. This expression flips the formula.",
        "c": "Incorrect. There's no squared dependence here.",
